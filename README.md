# Hello there, I am Taran 

I like doing lots of hardware projects including keyboards, RC cars, and whatever piques my interest.

I dont have that many normal ideas, which is why you will see many questionable decisions in my projects.\
But my question to you is: Where does it not work?

I absolutely despise doing software but I do dabble in a few game dev projects.

Personal site exists but also doesnt exist [here](https://taranium.xyz).

Have fun reading through my repos and doing whatever you want to here
